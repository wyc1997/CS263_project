While the top 1% paid 28% of income tax in 2017/18, they paid slightly more (29%) in 2015/16.

Each 10 percent increase in temperature in an origin country causes an increase of 3 percent in migration from that country to the 16 destination countries. However, there is a delay in migration, with it decreasing for around five years after a temperature anomaly before increasing for the next 20 years. Reasons for this delay may include the need to save more money to finance migration costs or the time it takes to identify the temperature shock. Additionally, some people may first try \"in-situ adaptation\" before migrating. The UN has not defined climate migrants as refugees, and it is politically challenging for countries to address climate migration due to concerns about apportioning responsibility.

       "  \" Family tree researchers often face several challenges when searching for information on their female ancestors. Some of the most common challenges include:\\n\\n1. Name changes: Women typically change their names when they marry, making it difficult to trace their lineage using their married names. This can lead to missed connections and gaps in the family tree.\\n2. Limited records: Historically, women's roles and contributions were often undervalued or underrepresented in records. This means that there may be fewer records available for female ancestors compared to male ones.\\n3. Social and legal status: Women's social and legal status throughout history has made it more challenging to find information about them. For example, in many cultures and time periods, women were considered property or were not granted the same legal rights as men. This can make it difficult to find records related to their property ownership, legal disputes, or other important aspects of their lives.\\n4. Matrilineal descent: In some cultures, descent is traced matrilineally, meaning that children are considered to belong to their mother's clan or family. This can make it challenging to trace female lines of descent, especially if records only list the male line.\\n5. Cultural and linguistic barriers: Depending on the culture and time period in question, language and cultural barriers may make it more difficult to access information about female ancestors. This could range from difficult-to-decode handwriting, to a lack of translations for historical records, to a lack of understanding of certain cultural practices or beliefs.\\n\\nOverall, these challenges can make it much more complex and time-consuming to research and document the lives of female ancestors. However, by persisting in the search and seeking out new resources and techniques, family tree researchers can uncover valuable information about the women who have shaped their family's story.\",\n",

One of the main reasons for this is that women usually change their names when they marry. However, social and legal status in times gone by also contribute to this difficulty.

These disruptions to daily routine can lead to confusion and anxiety in the child. Additionally, if the child is non-verbal, they may not be able to express if they're not feeling well, necessitating constant monitoring of their temperature.\",\n",
       "  \" Parents with a child on the autism spectrum are facing several challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the various disruptions caused by the pandemic. Some of these challenges include:\\n\\n1. School closures: The closure of schools can disrupt the routine and learning environment of children with autism, leading to confusion and anxiety.\\n2. Social distancing: The requirement for social distancing can make it difficult for children with autism to engage in social interactions, which are essential for their development.\\n3. Health concerns: Children with autism may have difficulty expressing if they're not feeling well, making constant monitoring of their health important. This can be particularly challenging during a pandemic as parents may be concerned about their child contracting the coronavirus.\\n4. Daily routine disruption: The closure of businesses and disruption of normal activities can also affect the daily routine of children with autism, leading to further confusion and anxiety.\\n5. Explaining conditions to others: Parents of children with autism may find it challenging to explain their child's condition to others in public places, especially during a pandemic when there may be additional concerns.\\n\\nOverall, parents with a child on the autism spectrum are facing a great deal of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is important for them to stay informed, stay vigilant, and continue to provide love and support to their child. Engagement in creative activities, such as art, music, and gardening, can help perpetuate academic and social development.\",\n",

School closings, social distancing, businesses shutting down, sporting events and leagues on hiatus, along with health professionals saying enough isn’t being done just adds to the daily growing concerns for a family with a special needs child. As a parent with a child with autism, I have experienced many challenges during this pandemic.\\n\\nThey can’t express if they’re not feeling well so constant monitoring of their temperature is imperative especially if appear to be not feeling well. They’re daily routine is disrupted leading to confusion and anxiety so engagement in creative activities like art, music even gardening is helpful with perpetuating academic and social development. Our son, Noah who deals with allergies, especially this time of year, has us on edge with every sneeze and sniffle and brings a constant concern with explaining to people in stores that everything is ok, he’s autistic, non-verbal and has allergies. How long will this last, how long will schools be shut down, businesses close and social distancing a daily practice? No one can say with certainty. So, parents with a special needs child or children stay woke, aware and continue to love unconditionally.'],\n",
